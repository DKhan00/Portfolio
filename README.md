# About
### Data and Modeling Projects
This repository consists of my abilities to explore data, model data, and present my findings through a variety of different ways across multiple different coding languages.

# Works/Projects
### COVID Case Study
This project demonstrated my ability to assess subjective online data and form my own analysis in the form of a case study. When it comes to data understanding, there are many ethical concerns involves, from bias to individual perceptions. Filtering through political and ethical viewpoints of the COVID pandemic allowed me to demonstrate my ability to arrive at object conclusions from subjective data.
### Hello World
This is the first time ever I used Python as a language. I was able to create the classic hello world program with my own personalized additions. This demonstrates a contrast with all other documents, as it really shows that we all truly do have to start from somewhere.
### Weather IO Program
This project demonstrated my ability to create an IO program from start to finish. This incorporates all the major techniques and syntax used in Python programming. This is probably one of my strongest highlights from the program.
### Consumerism EDA
This project was entirely completed using the R language. It demonstrates my ability to use a niche language to dive into data analysis and data wrangling so come up with a useable solution for a real-world business application. This was a major step in my ability to connect my exploratory work with a real-world application.
### Housing EDA
This project was my first introduction in Jupyter Notebook. I demonstrated proficient use of the IDE, and advanced statistical analysis using the Python language. I was able to connect to GitHub repositories and use published code and libraries to arrive at conclusions.
### Pollution Data Wrangling
This project combined my knowledge of importing and processing data from multiple sources. Such as saved files, APIs, and utilizing HTML. Here I thoroughly demonstrated my ability to import data, create data frames, assess data integrity, and use a variety of different visuals and analysis techniques to compare my conclusion across all data sources.
### Text Modeling
This was one of my first introductions into modeling and machine learning. The ability to process text as numerical vectors to determine if a model can assess whether the text is a positive or negative opinion, expanded my scope of understand the world of machine learning. This represents one of the most unique tasks Iâ€™ve ever completed in the program.
### Housing Modeling
This project was my first introduction into how to use machine learning to use existing data and create a predictive output that can potentially solve a future problem. I was able to clean data, train a model, create predictive outputs that in turn helped me to optimize the model further. This allowed me to use machine learning to connect my predictive analysis with a real-world application.
### Recommender System
This was a circle back into an IO program for me but tied in with advanced data processing techniques. Here I was able to take a data frame of subject movie ratings, and recommend which one a user should watch next, based on their input. Processing the data for correlation along with IO syntax allowed me to connect multiple ideas all at once.
### Dashboard Analytics
This was one of my first yet in-depth introduction into using Tableau. Here I realized that sometimes to tell a story with data, simple visuals for anyone to see and interact with, go a longer way with communication, compared to writing code for the same level of analysis. Here I learned how to tell a story through data, in a format that is universally understood by a larger audience, compared to technical jargon present in code.
